# Hi, Iâ€™m Sara! ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m a software engineer currently working at [US Med-Equip](https://usme.com/).  I donâ€™t believe in marrying languages or frameworks, but Iâ€™m particularly fond of .NET, Angular, TypeScript and Rust.

Besides programming, I enjoy learning languages (especially on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/saraelsaz) where I have a 1-year+ streak!) and studying STEM. My favorite sport is ice hockeyâ€“even though I may not have gotten the opportunity to play it yet.

## Projects Iâ€™m proud of
I try to give all my projects my best, but there are some Iâ€™m especially proud of having built. Feel welcome to check them out any timeâ€“theyâ€™re open-source, right here on GitHub!

### Auth Armorâ€™s JavaScript SDKs
That means [autharmor-js](https://github.com/AuthArmor/autharmor-js) and [autharmor-js-ui](https://github.com/AuthArmor/autharmor-js-ui). If you donâ€™t know, Auth Armor is an authentication solution (similar to Auth0 and Okta) thatâ€™s built exclusively for password-less authentication. The JavaScript SDKs play the role of allowing you to embed our authentication forms into your web application.

### Community MSAL implementation for Solid.JS
Thatâ€™s [msal-community-solid](https://github.com/saraelsa/msal-community-solid). Itâ€™s a wrapper around [msal-browser](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/master/lib/msal-browser) by Microsoft which allows you to authenticate users against one of the auth solutions provided by Microsoft (Azure Active Directory and Azure Active Directory B2C). Itâ€™s modeled after Microsoftâ€™s official wrapper for React, but, as the name implies, is intended for use with Solid.JS.

## My work experience
Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working in a variety of different environments. Here follows an overview of what happened in each.
